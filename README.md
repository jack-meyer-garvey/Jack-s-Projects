# Physics Engine
Repo for my Physics Engine and textbox generator: 

Written using the tkinter GUI

All art is by me.

It uses a spacial hash map to keep track of the objects
and Euler's method to approximate the physics. 

My textbox generator is incredibly flexible and easy to implement to any tkinter project.
