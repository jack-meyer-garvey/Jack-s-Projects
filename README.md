# Jack-s-Projects
Repo for my biggest projects. Here is a list of them:
1. Four Space - a 4D puzzle solving game that I programmed in Python tkinter. It uses a 2D grid system to keep track of the characters. 

2. PlatFormer - a Physics simulator with a working textbox library written by me. It uses a spacial hash map to keep track of the objects
and Euler's method to approximate the physics. 

3. PlatformerTextbox - a textbox generator library easily implementable for any tkinter project. It uses a queue system to save the textboxes. 
It is almost entirely centered around the textBox function, which takes in string.
